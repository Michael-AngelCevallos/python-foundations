    1. From Home Page Click Icon, 
        IF ANOTHER PROJECT OPENS, click File(in VS Code) then clcikc close folder , tAKES YOU TO MAIN PAGE IN vscODE, sELECT wHICH FOLDER TO OPEN. tHIS FOLDER IS C:\Users\micha\projects\python\python-foundations


 2. Open python-foundations

Do ONE small thing:

Add notes

Add a tiny exercise


hOW TO COMMIT AND PUSH
1ST. FILE SAVE, THEN COMMMIT

Commit:

git add .
git commit -m "Day X: <what you learned>"
git push origin main


Even a 5-line change counts.
