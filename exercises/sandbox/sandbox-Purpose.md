Sandbox Folder — What This Is

The sandbox folder is a practice-only space.

It’s where I experiment with Python concepts whenever I want, without worrying about lesson order or daily progress.

When to Use the Sandbox

Use the sandbox when:

    I want to practice something again (like for loops)

    I want to try a concept randomly

    I’m confused and need extra repetition

    I want to test an idea quickly

    There is no schedule and no structure requirement here.

How It Works

Files are named by topic, not by day

Code can be messy or incomplete — that’s okay

This folder is for learning, not perfection

Example files:

for_loops_practice.py

list_experiments.py

string_methods_test.py

Sandbox vs Daily Exercises

daily/ → follows the learning plan, one day at a time

sandbox/ → free practice, anytime, any topic

One Rule

If I’m experimenting or reviewing something out of order, it goes in the sandbox.
